# Stochastic-Processes-Report

This repository holds the final report of a synthesis on three stochastic processes: Martingales, Renewal Processes, and Brownian Motion. Creating the report served as a way for me to expand my understanding of probability modeling while also producing a digestible guide for future probability students to learn from.

To assist in the creation of this report, I referenced probability textbooks, past course materials, and statistics discussion boards. In some instances, AI tools were used to suggest changes in wording and verbiage to maximize brevity and clarity.
